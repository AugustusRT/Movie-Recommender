    "In this project, I create a simple movie scoring algorithm that predicts a users movie ratings based on that user's existing movie ratings and the ratings of similar users. The data is from the MovieLens database (details in the Data section). I use proximal gradient descent as the optimization algorithm for the penalized problem. \n",

Note that this is a convex relaxation of the original recommender system formulation, which attempts to minimize the rank of the matrix X (NP-Hard).\n",

    "The idea here is that we have a table of movies and many viewers, and each viewer as watch some tiny fraction of the movies and rated them. The output of this algorithm is the completed table, where the missing ratings for each movie are inferred from group data (similar users). "
